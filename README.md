# LiH_dissociation_curve

Hi George!

Could you please run LIH.py with a single parameter running from 1.0 to 3.0 with a step 0.1 (21 points)? It is important to use 1.0,2.0,3.0 instead of 1,2,3, as these will be compared against the name in the MolecularHamiltonian folder. The only critical dependencies are openfermion,scipy,numpy and pickle. If openfermion is a problem, I can get read of it by programming the used functionality myself, but hopefully it's not necessary.

Thank you!

Vlad
